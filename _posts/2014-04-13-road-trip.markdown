For the last few years, the idea of an open road has [captivated me](https://twitter.com/srtfisher/status/450630127228321792) very much so. Going on an endless journey with no limit on where you can stop is my definition of excitement. Being that I am from a very urbanized area (NYC), the open road as well as the tranquility of being outside of the city is calling my name. During this trip, I plan on obtaining one goal in particular: *disconnection*.

Disconnecting from email, social networks and life itself. Focusing on the road ahead of you and having no limitation on where you go today.

##The Plan

For this roadtrip, there is a line between planning it out fully and wandering out without one. I feel that the balance between plan and unplanned is something that would be best. Plotting some ideas down will let us make the most of the road trip.

The Northeast won't be radically different from the tri-state area (NYC metropolitan area). Some highlights:

**Washington, DC**

Not my first time in this city but it's great everytime. Some highlights I would love to visit/re-visit:

- Capitol
- White House
- Abraham Lincoln Memorial
- FDR Memorial

Not sure if we'll make it to the museums for time purposes.

Probably the most exciting leg of this trek. Since meeting up with Route-66 in St. Louis, we arere going to be (mostly) staying true to Route 66. Hopefully some great photography comes of this leg of some beautiful red rocks in the Southwest United States.
