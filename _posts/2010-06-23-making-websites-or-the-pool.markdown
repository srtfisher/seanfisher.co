The summer is already going quite quickly, and it's onlyRecently, I have had the pleasure (and time) to improve some websites very dear to me. <a href="http://theinternationalinsider.com">The International Insider </a> and <a href="http://csihighschool.org">CSI High School</a> websites have been in dire need of a redesign for quite some time. I hope that I can recieve some positive feedback on these redesigns as well as see these websites develop into a community in some sense. Now I really see how hard it is to obtain a visitor's attention!

Oh and did I mention that both websites are powered by the wonderful, open-source <a href="http://WordPress.org/">WordPress</a>? WordPress 3.0 has some <em>amazing</em> features!
