I just wanted to let you know that I pushed out&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lockdown-wp-admin/stats/">Lockdown WP Admin 1.2</a> yesterday and I<strong>strongly </strong>urge you to update. It is a very critical security update and without it, your site may be at risk. I also threw in some code optimizations so it may run a few ms faster! (#nerdlife)

Please, please,&nbsp;<strong>please</strong> update to Version 1.2 as soon as you can. You can visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lockdown-wp-admin/stats/">Lockdown WP Admin</a> page on WordPress.org or you can update it straight in WordPress via the Plugin Updater.

Thank you for using this software and I would love to hear feedback from you!
