ImageBrief is a crowdsourcing system for stock photos. Instead of
finding photos normally by searching and attempting to find a photo that
matches your needs, ImageBrief will work with your to find a perfect
image.

Inheriting a young startup code base, worked to develop and implement development
procedures to scale the product team. Building new subscription and social
campaign features as well as cleaning up legacy code and optimizing where needed.
Transforming the original user facing side of the application into a structured
base for building future product features with object oriented programming.
Transformed the integration between the front-end and back-end to be dynamic and
responsive. Rebuilt large portions of the website to ensure visibility and quality
user experience across all devices.
