We wanted to make learning to use TruantToday as simple as possible. To do so, we created a "textbook" of information to help start using TruantToday as well as different ways you can use TruantToday to curb truancy. The textbook, not yet released to the public, is going to compose of various help files that will make it dead simple to understand our interface. We are aiming for anybody from the age range of 20 to 65 to use our system so we have to make it simple.
