TruantToday strives to improve the lives &mdash; and educational experiences &mdash; of students everywhere. Truancy robs students of their education, schools of their funding, and communities of their safety, and TruantToday reduces and removes the corrosive influence that truancy has on these three groups.

I came on the project with a legacy code base that was built by various freelancing teams -- it was a mess. Rebuilding most of it under a new and updated CodeIgniter code base took a few weeks but was worth it in the end. Not only did the speed of the site improve, but the UI was updated to make it even&nbsp;simpler&nbsp;for the average teacher to use. We use data that is imported into our system to review various statistics for truancy in a school district and will work with them to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;TruantToday to curb truancy.
