<blockquote>Earning the Programming merit badge will take you &ldquo;behind the screen&rdquo; for a look at the complex codes that make digital devices useful and fun. Without programs, today&rsquo;s high-tech gadgets would be little more than empty shells. But given clear instructions, digital devices can do amazing things and perform operations that would have seemed like magic to people in the past.

By the time you fulfill the requirements for the Programming merit badge, you will be able to work a little of that &ldquo;magic&rdquo; yourself. And you might find yourself joining the legions of young programmers who create so much innovative software. Whatever the need, somebody somewhere has written a program to answer it. You could become that somebody. Happy programming!</blockquote>
