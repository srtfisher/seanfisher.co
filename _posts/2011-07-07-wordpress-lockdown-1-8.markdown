When I originally worked on this code for Teens in Tech, I never imagined that I could give it back to the community. Version after version, bugs were crushed and some features were added. With this latest release, one crucial bug was fixed that will allow for proper support of up to 80% of web installations. Some users weren't able to use the plugin before due to their hosting setup, but now that has been fixed for the most part.&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lockdown-wp-admin/">Lockdown WP Admin 1.8</a>.
