Teens in Tech Labs provides tools and resources to young entrepreneurs world-wide to help encourage entrepreneurship at a young age. The company was founded on the premise that entrepreneurship doesn't happen at a certain age, or a certain location &mdash; it happens everywhere.

I developed a custom built application to manage the discussions platform, job board, and the Incubator Applications. Worked with the community to resource feedback about a new redesign and launched the application in July 2012.

The website is running on SoftLayer powered NGINX servers that require a Redis and a MySQL database. We also use APC to help cache "expensive" resources and keep everything loading lighting fast.
