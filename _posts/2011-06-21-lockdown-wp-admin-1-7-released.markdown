Several users were having issues with getting the hidden path setup. These were only temporarily put in so we could have an understanding of the issues that user's are having. They were just taken out in 1.7.

Nothing was violated. WordPress sends anonymous stats to the wordpress.org with your version information, plugin information, etc. These were never leaked, even though there was nothing vital that was collected. They just collected a permalink structure, WordPress version and the login base that was used. We&nbsp;<strong>never</strong>&nbsp;collected the admin's personal information.

But again, these are removed now. Update to 1.7.

You can download 1.7 now, virus free.&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lockdown-wp-admin/">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lockdown-wp-admin/</a>
