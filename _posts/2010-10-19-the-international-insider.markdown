The International Insider is the official newspaper for CSI High School for International Studies. Featuring international reporters and international stories, <em>The Insider</em> is a very diverse high school newspaper. Personally, I served as the Multimedia Director for the Newspaper for three years. This included the creation, development, update, and changes to the website. I also served as the Editor-in-Chief and Managing Editor for two year and a half years as well.
