Date Night Is... is a a service that helps to provide date ideas to couples. Created by [Danny](https://twitter.com/AmongMany) and [Joni](https://twitter.com/JoniGoldbach), it they ventured out to find a way to provide incredible date ideas to couples that would help their and other relationships alike.

Joining them, I helping them to make a product that would provide great ideas sourced from various sources as well as curated date ideas to the users of the application. Date Night Is... would become aparat of your relationship, reminding you of upcoming events (birthday and reminders) as well as ways to spice things up and add new date ideas to the mix.

###The Development

Working with Danny (who created the great UX and UI), it was a breeze to build the application from there and create a great experience for the end-user. From a backend point, we added the latest technologies into the mix from Elasticsearch to searching the index of dates, custom written algorithms to sort and provide a great list of dates to the user and Redis in-between to give a persistent and fast caching layer.

For the first part of the project, I provided an MVP to get the project going with continuous improvements after working with the team to tailor the project more so for the team's and their users' needs. 

###Full Stack Development

From the front to back, the application was written with modern development techniques to make sure that the application is fast, scalable and maintainable. Working with a number of moving parts in such a short period of time, getting it right was important to ensure a delightful user experience.
