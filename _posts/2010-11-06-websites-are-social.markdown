The internet is growing at a lighthing fast pace. Web Applications come and go each day, and user accounts are often a large part of these applications. Making it easy for a user to signup for your website is often a difficult decision. Make <em>another</em> login for your user or allow your user to connect to your site with a Social Network.

The rise of social network logins have grown tremendiously. <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook Connect</a> is one option, with the familiar "Login with Facebook" button. Another option is the newer<a href="http://dev.twitter.com/anywhere"> Twitter @Anywhere</a> connect buttons popping up as well.

I for one is very happy to see this. It makes that Facebook connect button very familiar. But I also fear that this&nbsp;dependence&nbsp;upon Facebook Connect can be&nbsp;unsafe. Unless something else comes up, I really will stick with Facebook Connect, rather than just Twitter Anywhere. The Twitter Anywhere doesn't really connect well with the SSI code. The&nbsp;back-end&nbsp;code has to setup to&nbsp;receive&nbsp;the oAuth tokens, while the @Anywhere is just different. Maybe it's a confusion on my end...
