God, social media it becoming more and more popular each day.

It's an unavoidable fact. You can use a social networking presence for jobs, friends, and more. That social&nbsp;presence&nbsp;can establish friendships in some pretty neat places, opening up job&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;and allow you to build your resume even more (you know, that thing people think isn't important until you get denied a job because of it). Networking efficiently (there are books about it) is key. I just ask one thing of you: talk to Twitter or Tumblr like you would talk to your mother.

Cursing on Facebook? Racist on Twitter? You know, if a job or a college saw that, what would they think?
