Appcelerator Inc. created a platform called Titanium&nbsp;for developing mobile, tablet and desktop applications using web technologies. While working with them to build a better mobile strategy for a mobile development company, the best solution would be to have a mobile optimized site to work with.

The website needed to be managed by multiple people across the organization, ranging from marketers to developers. Making it easy to edit the content as well as a beautiful design would make their mobile site easier to maintain in the future.
