This is my site
=========

You can see it in action at <http://seanfisher.co/>. It is powered by
[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and is transformed into an actual
site when I push to GitHub.

Seanfisher.co is a marketing/personal blog site for information about my portfolio
and services alike. Overtime, one can see the changes in copy, design, ideas etc.
to build out the site and further sell the brand.

### License
