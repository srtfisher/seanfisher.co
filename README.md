This is my site
=========

You can see it in action at <http://seanfisher.co/>. It is powered by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and is transformed into an actual site when I push to GitHub.

### License
I herby license all content in the `_posts` and `img` directories. You may not reuse anything inside them, all copyrighted by myself.

Everything else is MIT, fair gaim. Use it up.

### Installing and Building
To build the site, run this:

```shell
bower install # assumes you installed bower

grunt build # assumes you installed grunt

jekyll serve
```
